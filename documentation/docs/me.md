> I am Aallyn also known as Sly, I'm 23 years old and a self taught developer who mostly codes in Python.
I enjoy coding a lot, problem solving is something that keeps my brain occupied on my free time.
I've been learning coding since I got my first own computer in 2018 and ever since been taking on larger and larger challenges.

> I took a design course in high school which I completely despise to this day and due to financial and family reasons I was unable to this day to start college, but I am still aiming for it just gotta wait.

> I am not an active Trove player, I played very little on the Live server back in July/August 2015 and became more active towards the game back in 2018 during PTS openings, whilst I enjoy coding towards the game as a 3rd party tool provider I don't enjoy playing it at all.

> I played a ton of PTS and got to know some pretty cool people that at the time started dreaming about certain ways of connecting to discord Trove, started out the Trove Bot for Discord project within my own PTS Club server as a fun side-project but as I built features people started liking it more and more.

> Due to some discord decisions and drama within the library I was using at the time to interact with Discord API I ended up putting the bot in a EOF process that I was lazy to update, that's when I found some weird interface library that used Flutter a multiplatform interface engine? it allowed me to develop once for web and desktop which made it much easier to develop something new and out of Discord's shadow.

> That's how Renewed Trove Tools came to be firstly as a web app now as both web and desktop, aimed at replacing the outdated TroveTools.NET however of course valid to still use it.

> With this new app came the need to have an API to contact my server and make connected services such as build ID's, star chart ID's, mods list, etc, so why not make this thing public for people to build upon.

> I hope you all keep enjoying my work, I try my best to deliver good systems within the scope of my ability and always looking for feedback on how to improve them.
