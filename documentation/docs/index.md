I host this out of my pocket with occasional support from people who like my work.
It is under engineered in many ways and I'd like to keep this a simple fun project.
The API has the goal of providing other developers with tools and data that otherwise they'd also have to get.

Please use it with reasoning in mind, my host isn't the best out there it can handle some load but not an ungodly amount of spam.

## Cloudflare
The server is under cloudflare so you may expect their system's behavior on top of my server.
